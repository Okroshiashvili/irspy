WIP: Write here how the project is structured.

## Setup Local Development Environment

First you need to clone the repository. After that you need to setup your development environment.

I use [pixi](https://prefix.dev/) to manage dependencies and environment. To install it, [go and check the documentation](https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation).

If you already have `pixi`, then just run.

```bash
pixi install
```
